# Emergency Department Simulation

This project is part of an Object oriented software design course at CentraleSupelec University.

Our final project intends to simulate an Emergency Department (ED), which assesses and treats people who present without prior appointment. This medical facility works often 24 hours a day and seven days a week, as ED workers have to deal with an unplanned patients’ attendance. Furthermore, time is an essential factor in emergency treatment. 

Thus, it is important to provide a simulation platform to analyze the resources distribution and the patient’s workflow, to ensure that the ED operates correctly and effectively. Thereby, our goal was to develop a JAVA software framework that is able to:

- Represent an ED with all of its relevant resources (human and material) and workflow events;

- Simulate various test cases and automatically calculate suitable Key Performance Indicators
(KPI)

The project includes:

- A CLUI implementation with relevant Use Case Tests 

- A GUI platform which allows to make various simulations depending on the ED resources.
